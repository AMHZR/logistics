SETUP

To set up the logistics project, you'll need to get the submodules by running:

git submodule init
git submodule update

Then copy over the localsettings:

cp localsettings.py.example localsettings.py

Finally sync your database, and launch runserver and runrouter.

./manage.py syncdb 
./manage.py runserver &
./manage.py runrouter &
