SETUP

To set up the logistics project, you'll need to get the submodules by running:

git clone git://github.com/dimagi/logistics.git
cd logistics
git submodule init
git submodule update

Then copy over the localsettings:

cd logistics
cp localsettings.py.example localsettings.py

Finally sync your database, and launch runserver and runrouter.

./manage.py syncdb 
python setup.py
./manage.py runserver &
./manage.py runrouter &
